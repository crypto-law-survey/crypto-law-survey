This is a survey of existing and proposed laws and regulations on cryptography - systems used for protecting information against unauthorized access. Governments have long restricted export of cryptography for fear that their intelligence activities are hampered by the crypto use of foreign states and scoundrels. Since the rise of crypto use over the past decades, governments increasingly worry about criminals using cryptography to thwart law enforcement. Thus, many countries have passed laws or are considering laws to maintain law-enforcement and national-security capabilities through regulation of cryptography.

This survey aims to give an overview of the current state of affairs, with entries per country on import/export controls, domestic laws, developments to restrict cryptography, and developments favoring crypto use. For more  **background**  on the crypto policy dilemma, see Bert-Jaap's Ph.D. thesis _The Crypto Controversy. A Key Conflict in the Information Society_  (Kluwer Law International, 1999).

Cryptography used for  **digital signatures**  is not covered by this survey. For regulation of digital signatures, see  [Digital Signatures and Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures_and_law).
