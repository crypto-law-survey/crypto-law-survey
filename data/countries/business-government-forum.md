**1. Export/ import controls / 3. Developments in cryptography

On 19-20 December 1995, a meeting was held at the International Chamber
of Commerce in Paris, with governments, businesses and computer experts
attending. According to an ICC press release, the \"meeting ended in
agreement that \[encryption\] controls should be kept to a minimum,
consistent with the requirements of law enforcement and national
security\". Businesses agreed that independent trusted third parties
could hold deposited keys, to which governments are allowed access under
proper judicial warrant, provided sufficient safeguards are in place.
Some governments appeared willing to relax export controls on strong
cryptography as long as these safeguards applied. A second Business
Government Forum on Global Cryptography Policy was held on 7 May 1996 in
Washington, DC.
