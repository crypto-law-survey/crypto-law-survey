## 1. Export/ import controls  
A license is required for exporting encryption software or hardware, in
accordance with the [EU dual-use goods regulation](#eu_exp) and the
(pre-December 1998) [Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) Arrangement, including the
General Software Note.

Import of cryptography is regulated as well, through a 1993 law; a
general authorization or import certificate is required to buy
encryption products abroad. The end-user must detail the kind of
information to be encrypted and where the cryptography is to be
installed. Legitimate businesses will be helped with their application.
There is no need for declaration for crypto software exported from
abroad under the Wassenaar General Software Note.

## 2. Domestic laws and regulations  
None.
