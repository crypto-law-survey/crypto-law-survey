**1. Export/ import controls**\
Import and export of cryptography require a license from the
Director-General of the Ministry of Defence (who is aided in this by an
advisory committee). The Director-General can grant a general license
for certain crypto to make it freely exportable. There is no specific
limit on key size. Licenses are granted on a case-by-case basis;
according to the statistics
([2002](http://www.mod.gov.il/encryption/pdfs/stat02.pdf), [Jan-Jun
2003](http://www.mod.gov.il/encryption/pdfs/stat_01012003_30062003.pdf))
most requests are granted. See [Encryption Controls in
Israel](http://www.mod.gov.il/pages/encryption/preface.asp) for the
applicable laws and the Ministry of Defence DDEC\'s
[policy](http://www.mod.gov.il/pages/encryption/policy.asp) of control
and licensing, where
[forms](http://www.mod.gov.il/pages/encryption/forms.asp) are available
for requesting a license.

See the [address](cls-addr.htm) list for contact details.

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
Engagement in means of cryptography (including use, manufacture,
transport, and distribution) is
[regulated](http://www.mod.gov.il/encryption/preface.asp) and requires a
license from the Director-General of the Ministry of Defence (who is
aided in this by an advisory committee). The Director-General can grant
a general license for certain crypto that is subsequently free for use
or distribution. Persons are exempted from applying for a license for
engagement if they purchase from a license holder for sale and
distribution, or if they download the crypto from the Internet for
personal use.

According to an
[article](http://www.netvision.net.il/~ravia/articles.htm) (click on
\"The New Code Order\") by Haim Ravia, the applicable laws are:

-   Control of Commodities and Services (Weapons and Security Know-How)
    Declaration, 5747-1986
-   Control of Exports (Weapons and Military Know-How) Order, 5737-1977
-   Control of Commodities and Services Law, 5718-1957
-   Control of Commodities and Services (Engagement in Means of
    Encryption) Order, 5734-1974
-   Commodities and Services (Engagement in Means of Encryption)
    (Amendment) Declaration, 5758-1998
-   Commodities and Services (Engagement in Means of Encryption)
    (Amendment) Order, 5758-1998

See [Encryption Control
Regulations](http://www.mod.gov.il/encryption/preface.asp) and the
[Encryption Policy](http://www.mod.gov.il/encryption/policy.asp) of the
Ministry of Defence DDEC for the applicable laws.

Apparently, licenses are virtually always granted. No prosecutions for
using unlicensed crypto are known, and strong encryption is widely used
in Israel. See the Ministry of Defence DDEC\'s
[policy](http://www.mod.gov.il/encryption/policy.asp) of control and
licensing, where [forms](http://www.mod.gov.il/encryption/forms.asp) are
available for requesting a license.
