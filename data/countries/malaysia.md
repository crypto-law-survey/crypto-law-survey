Three Acts contain a power to require people to decrypt *during a
search*; such a search is allowed when there is reasonable cause to
believe that an *offence under the Act at issue* is being or has been
committed. There is therefore no general power to order decryption.

-   Art. 10 (1) (b) of the [Computer Crimes Act
    1997](http://www.mycert.mimos.my/crime.html) requires (likely) users
    and people otherwise concerned with the operation of computers or
    material, during a search, to provide reasonable assistance for the
    purpose of accessing programs or data or material that is reasonably
    suspected to be used in connection with an offence under the Act, as
    well as to produce any information contained in a computer and
    accessible from the premises to be produced in a form in which it
    can be taken away and in which it is visible and legible. Refusal to
    cooperate is punishable with at most 25k ringgit and/or three
    years\' imprisonment (art. 11).
-   Art. 79 of the [Digital Signature Act
    1997](http://www.cca.gov.my/1997.htm) requires people, during a
    search, to give access to computerised data whether stored in a
    computer or otherwise, which includes providing the necessary
    password, encryption code, decryption code, software or hardware
    required to enable comprehension of computerised data. Refusal to
    cooperate is punishable with at most 200k ringgit and/or four
    years\' imprisonment (art. 83).
-   Art. 249 of the [Communications and Multimedia
    Act](http://www.cmc.gov.my/akta588/eng/legis_cma1998_pg3.htm)
    requires people, during a search, to give access to computerised
    data whether stored in a computer or otherwise, which includes
    providing the necessary password, encryption code, decryption code,
    software or hardware required to enable comprehension of
    computerised data. Refusal to cooperate is punishable with at most
    100k ringgit and/or two years\' imprisonment (art. 242). This Act
    contains a provision (art. 256(2)) allowing people to refuse
    answering questions if they thereby would incriminate themselves; by
    contrast, the privilege against self-incrimination can be deemed not
    to hold for complying with a decryption order.
