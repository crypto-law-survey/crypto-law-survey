**1. Export/ import controls**\
Import is not controlled.

Export is regulated according to the [EU](#eu_exp) dual-goods regulation
and the [Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) Arrangement, including the restriction
of free export for mass-market software to 64-bit key lengths. The
*[Framework](http://www.irlgov.ie/tec/communications/signat.htm) for
Ireland\'s Policy on Cryptography and Electronic Signatures* of June
1998 and the [Consultation Paper](http://www.ecommercegov.ie/) of August
1999 affirm the commitment to this legislation.

The responsible agency is The Licensing Unit of the Department of
Enterprise, Trade and Employment (see [address](cls-addr.htm)).

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
The [Electronic Commerce Act
2000](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0027/print.html)
(nr. 27), which was enacted on 19 July 2000, contains a decryption order
in article 27 (2) (c). A judge can issue a search warrant if there are
reasonable grounds to suspect an offence under the Act has been
committed. Such a warrant authorises investigation officers, among other
things, \"when the thing seized is or contains information or an
electronic communication that cannot readily be accessed or put into
intelligible form, to require the disclosure of the information or
electronic communication in intelligible form\". Persons or public
bodies who fail or refuse to comply are guilty of a summary offence
(art. 27 (4)). Failure to comply is punishable, on summary conviction,
with a fine of up to 1500£ or imprisonment of up to one year or, on
conviction on indictment, with a fine of up to 500,000£ or up to five
years\' imprisonment (art. 8).\
According to article 28, \"Nothing in this Act shall be construed as
requiring the disclosure or enabling the seizure of unique data, such as
codes, passwords, algorithms, private cryptographic keys, or other data,
that may be necessary to render information or an electronic
communication intelligible.\" Hence, investigation officers can only
require people to decrypt, not to hand over keys or passwords, and the
power can only be used in relation to material seized during a search.
The Act does not make an exception for suspects or mention the privilege
against self- incrimination.

**History**\
The *[Framework](http://www.irlgov.ie/tec/communications/signat.htm) for
Ireland\'s Policy on Cryptography and Electronic Signatures* of June
1998 included the following basic principles: \"The production, import
and use of encryption shall not be subject to any regulatory controls
\'other than obligations relating to lawful access\'\", and
\"Legislation will be enacted to oblige crypto users to release
plaintext or crypto keys upon a lawful authorisation.\"\
The [Consultation Paper](http://www.ecommercegov.ie/) *Outline of
Legislative Proposals on electronic signatures, electronic contracts,
certification service provision and related matters* of August 1999 had
a smaller set of basic principles, including \"The production, import
and use of cryptography will continue to be free from regulation.\" So,
the lawful-access principle had been altered. The relevant [section
20](http://www.ecommercegov.ie/s20.html) of the Consultation Paper
entailed a power to search and seize, but it did not contain a provision
on requiring access to plaintext or crypto keys. According to the
explanatory note, this provision provided lawful access to evidence, and
it was not an enabler of mandatory key escrow or key recovery.

**3. Developments in cryptography regulation**\
The *[Framework](http://www.irlgov.ie/tec/communications/signat.htm) for
Ireland\'s Policy on Cryptography and Electronic Signatures* of June
1998 comprised the following basic principles:

-   Users shall have the right to access strong and secure encryption
    and to choose any cryptographic method.
-   The production, import and use of encryption shall not be subject to
    any regulatory controls \"other than obligations relating to lawful
    access\".
-   Legislation will be enacted to oblige crypto users to release
    plaintext or crypto keys upon a lawful authorisation.

The [Consultation Paper](http://www.ecommercegov.ie/) *Outline of
Legislative Proposals on electronic signatures, electronic contracts,
certification service provision and related matters* of August 1999 has
a smaller set of basic principles:

-   E-commerce users have the right to access strong and secure
    encryption, and users have the right to choose any cryptographic
    method. (Does this mean that non-e-commerce users of cryptography do
    not have the right to access strong crypto?)
-   The production, import and use of cryptography will continue to be
    free from regulation.

On the history of the lawful-access principle, see above at 2.
