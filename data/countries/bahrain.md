**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
Cryptography is not allowed in telecommunications networks using the
radio frequency spectrum. Section 50 of the 2002 Telecommunications Law
(see [unofficial

stipulates that frequency license holders may not use secret signs or
codes in messages or conversations over their telecommunications network
in contravention of the regulations.
