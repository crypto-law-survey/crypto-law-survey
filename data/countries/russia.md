**1. Export/ import controls**\
A license is required for the importation of encryption facilities
manufactured abroad. The export of cryptography is subjected to a
tightened state control. Importers and exporters need licenses by the
Ministry of Trade. Russia has signed the [Wassenaar](#Wassenaar)
Arrangement, but does not implement the (pre-December 1998) General
Software Note; its regulations are more stringent than the Wassenaar
Arrangement.

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
On 3 April 1995, president Yeltsin issued a decree prohibiting
unauthorized encryption. State organizations and enterprises need a
license to use encryption (for both authentication and secrecy, for
storage as well as transmission). Other enterprises and organizations
using uncertified cryptography do not receive state orders. The Central
Bank shall take measures against commercial banks that do not use
certified cryptography when communicating with divisions of the Central
Bank.\
The development, production, sale, implementation, or operation of
cryptography without a license is prohibited. Apparently, a license is
also required for all users for using cryptography.

Licenses are issued by the Federal Security Service, FSB, in which the
former FAPSI (the Federal Bureau for Government Information, a former
department of the KGB) was integrated in 2003. The license process is
based on internal regulations.

The government intended to amend the domestic regulations on
cryptography, it announced in a Duma hearing on 18 May 2000. \[source:
