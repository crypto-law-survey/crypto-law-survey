## 1. Export/ import controls  
Norway has signed the [Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) Arrangement, including the
(pre-December 1998) General Software Note. Export is regulated by the
Strategic Goods Export Control Act of 18 December 1987, nr. 93 ([Lov om
kontroll med eksport av strategiske varer, tjenester og teknologi
m.v.](http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-19871218-093.html)) and the
accompanying regulations of 10 January 1989, nr. 51 ([Forskrift til
gjennomføring av utførselsreguleringen for strategiske varer, tjenester
og teknologi](http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/ud/xd-19890110-0051.html)).

There are no import controls. The 2001 policy document (see below, at 3)
states that import of cryptography will remain free.

## 2. Domestic laws and regulations  
None.

## 3. Developments in cryptography regulation  
In August 2001, the Norwegian government released their Norwegian Crypto
Policy ([Norsk
kryptopolitikk](http://odin.dep.no/nhd/norsk/enorge/p10001878/024101-990058/index-dok000-b-n-a.html),
text in Norwegian). The policy in general takes a positive stance
towards cryptography, arguing its value for securing data and for the
economy. The policy declares itself against mandatory key-escrow, at
least as far as individuals\' use of cryptography for private purposes
and authentication-only cryptography are concerned. Local mandatory
key-escrow is, however, recommended for companies for internal use,
because of the risk of data loss when a crypto key is lost. The policy
also indicates that telecommunications service providers, including
Internet access providers, can be required to provide plaintext to the
government, if they are in possession of the plaintext or of the keys to
produce the plaintext.\

policy](http://www.afin.uio.no/forskning/notater/kryptopolitikk_rapport_final.pdf)

At the [OECD meeting](#oecd) of December 1995, Norway called in question
the use of Trusted Third Parties for judicial access to keys.
