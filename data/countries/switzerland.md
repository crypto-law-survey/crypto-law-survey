**1. Export/ import controls**\
Crypto import is not controlled. Import certificates will be given if
the country of origin requires this.

The export of cryptography is regulated by the Goods Control Decree of
25 June 1997 (*Verordnung über die Aus-, Ein- und Durchfuhr zivil und
militärisch verwendbarer Güter sowie besonderer militärischer Güter*)
(text in [German](http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/c946_202_1.html) or
[English](http://www.admin.ch/bawi/f/kontroll/gkve.pdf)), which is based
on the Goods Control Law of 13 December 1996 (text in
[German](http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/c946_202.html) or
[English](http://www.admin.ch/bawi/f/kontroll/gkge.pdf)), in force since
1 October 1997. The export controls mirror the (pre-December 1998)
[Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) Arrangement, including the General Software Note
which excludes mass-market and public-domain software from the controls.
Export to the about 25 members of the four international export control
regimes (Australia Group, Missile Technology Control Regime, Nuclear
Suppliers Group, Wassenaar Arrangement) requires an ordinary general
license issued within a few days; export to other countries requires an
individual license, although for exports to *bona fide* companies in
uncritical countries, an extraordinary general license may be given.
Crypto export through intangible means is covered by these regulations.

Re-export is not permitted if the country of origin does not allow the
export to the destination country.

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
Study \[1\] did not find cryptography regulations, but its follow-up
study \[9\] claims there was a restriction on the use of certain
cryptography: radio communications must remain understandable, and if a
person wants to encrypt messages for professional reasons, he must
obtain specific permission. This is presumably the same law as the paper
to the [OECD](#oecd) December 1995 meeting refers to: article 14 of the
Telecommunications Concession Regulation (VFKV) required a license for
radio traffic encryption; the license was given if the concessionaire
can prove he needs confidentiality of his messages.\
The VFKV regulation were replaced on 1 January 1998 by the Frequency
Management and Radio License
[Decree](http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/7/784.102.1.de.pdf) (Verordnung
ueber Frequenzmanagement und Funkkonzessionen, FKV, current version from
9 March 2007). There is no license requirement for radio encryption, but
article 10 on identification of broadcasts provides that if the radio
traffic is not conducted in plain speech, the License Board will
establish how identification of the traffic is to take place (para. 2),
and the Board can rquire to make available the contents of the radio
traffic (para. 3).

Encryption products that can be connected to a public telecommunications
network must follow certain basic technical requirements, posed by the
Swiss Federal Council, to ensure overall compatibility. This can be done
by a declaration of conformity issued by the manufacturer, or by a
review by the Federal Office for Communications (OFCOM).

Apart from these two specific regulations, there are no domestic crypto
regulations.

**3. Developments in cryptography regulation**\
None.
