**1. Export/ import controls**\
Import and export of cryptography requires a license from the
government, according to Art. 13 of [Law No.
53-05](http://droitmaroc.wordpress.com/2008/01/29/loi-n°-53-05-relative-a-lechange-electronique-de-donnees-juridiques-integrale/)
(see under 2. Domestic laws). If the crypto only has the goal of
ensuring authenticity or integrity, then prior declaration to the
government suffices.** **

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
[Law No.
53-05](http://droitmaroc.wordpress.com/2008/01/29/loi-n°-53-05-relative-a-lechange-electronique-de-donnees-juridiques-integrale/)
of 30 November 2007 on Electronic Data Exchange (Loi 53-05 relative à
l\'échange électronique de données juridiques) inter alia regulates
cryptography services. Provision, utilisation (*exploitation*) and use
of cryptography requires a license from the government (Art. 13). (If
the crypto only has the goal of ensuring authenticity or integrity, then
prior declaration to the government suffices.) The government can
determine simplified regimes for certain types of crypto or for certain
user categories.

The provisioning of cryptography means and services is exclusively
reserved for electronic certification providers, and their personnel
must be approved by the government (Art. 14).
