## 1. Export/ import controls  
Export regulations are designed to implement the (pre-December 1998)
[Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) Arrangement, including the General Software
Note. Decisions are made on an individual basis. Japan seems to have
tightened its export controls in October 1996 (allegedly under US
pressure), establishing that businesses acquire approval for a
cryptography export order larger than 50,000 yen. In July 2000, MITI
announced its intention to mitigate the export controls for encryption
software for Internet use. 

## 2. Domestic laws and regulations  
None.

## 3. Developments in cryptography regulation  
Japan sees encryption as an important tool for establishing information
security in electronic commerce. Although initially it did not consider
encryption a threat to law enforcement or national security, Japan\'s
attitude seems to have shifted somewhat; the government has not (yet)
decided which approach to choose. See Stewart A. Baker\'s article [Japan
Enters the Crypto
Wars](http://www.hotwired.com/wired/4.09/es.crypto.html).

Japan\'s proposed wiretap law contains a reference to cryptography: if
encryption renders partial eavesdropping or wiretapping difficult,
law-enforcement is allowed to record all communications taking place.

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) (now called
[METI](http://www.meti.go.jp/english/)) published a draft policy paper
\"[Towards the Age of the Digital
Economy](http://www.meti.go.jp/english/aboutmeti/data/a228101e.html)\"
in May 1997. For ensuring security, encryption and authentication
technologies should be sophisticated through market competition.
Development of cryptography and experiments of projects should be
promoted, and network users should be provided with much more
information about these, according to the draft.
