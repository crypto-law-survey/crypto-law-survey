**1. Export/ import controls**\
Import of cryptography is restricted. It seems a government agency
(Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches des Télécoms, CERT) has to examine and
approve the crypto product. \[Note: this may have changed in light of
the  decrees mentioned below, but I have no specific recent information
on the import controls.\]\
I have no information about export restrictions in Tunisia.

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**  \
Telecommunication service providers need authorisation if they want to
use encryption, and they have to deposit keys with the government,
according to Decree No. 1997-501 of 14 March 1997 (Official Journal of
the Tunisian Republic, 25 September 1997). \[Source: 2000 [EPIC
survey](http://www2.epic.org/reports/crypto2000/)\] A September 1997
Order on crypto use in value-added telecoms services requires users and
service providers to apply for a license to use encryption, while
providing decryption keys. \[Source: 2005 HRW report [False

A later decree, No. 2001-2727 of 20 November 2001, regulates the
\"conditions and procedures for the use of encryption means or services
through telecommunications networks, as well as the exercise of related
activities\" \[source: [August 2002 Telecoms Market Access
Study](http://mkaccdb.eu.int/study/studies/29.doc)\]. This decree builds
on the September 1997 Order, stipulating that encryption is now
supervised by the Ministry of Defense and an encryption commission,
while requests for a license are to be sent to the National Agency for
Electronic Certification (ANCE), \"including a detailed description of
the means of encryption and a manual explaining how to use and program
the encryption technology\" \[source: 2005 HRW report [False
