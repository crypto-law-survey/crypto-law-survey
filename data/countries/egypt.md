**1. Export/ import controls**\
The import of tangible cryptography should take place through an
importer who is registered on the Importers Register prepared by the
Ministry of Economy and International Trade.

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
According to the 2005 HRW report [False
Freedom](http://hrw.org/reports/2005/mena1105/), communications service
operators and providers require permission for using encryption.
Permission has to be given by the state communications agencies,
national-security services and armed forces. Permission is granted only
for \'satisfactory\' reasons, which in practice has happened \'on
numerous occasions\'. 

**3. Developments in cryptography regulation\
**According to a [2002
document](http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/e-strategy/Seminars/CapeVerde/AfricaLegalFramework1.pdf)
by the ITU on the legal framework for e-commerce in Africa, an
\'encryption office shall be established for depositing the encryption
keys, safeguarding the encrypted data, which cannot be decoded unless
according to a court decision\', suggesting an intention to mandate key
escrow.
