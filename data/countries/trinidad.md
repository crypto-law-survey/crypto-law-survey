The [Computer Misuse Act,

contains a decryption order. Clause 16 provides that a \"police officer
executing a warrant (\...) is entitled (\...) to (\...) have access to
any information, code or technology which has the capability of
retransforming or unscrambling encrypted program or data held in or
available to such computer into readable and comprehensible format or
text for the purpose of investigating any offence under this Act or any
other offence which has been disclosed in the course of the lawful
exercise of the powers under this section; (\...) and entitled to
require any person in possession of decryption information to grant him
or the authorised person access to such decryption information necessary
to decrypt data required for the purpose of investigating an offence.\"
Failure to comply with a decryption order can be punished with a fine of
fifteen thousand dollars and imprisonment for two years.\
