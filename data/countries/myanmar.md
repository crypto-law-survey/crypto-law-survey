## 1. Export/ import controls  
Export and import of cryptography may be restricted on the basis of the
Computer Science Development Law (SLORC Law No. 10/96) of 20 September
1996, as amended by Law No. 3/98 of 23 February 1998. This law allows
the Myanmar Computer Science Development Council to prescribe types of
computer software and information that are not permitted to be imported
or exported; violation of this prohibition carries a sentence of 5 to 10
years\' imprisonment. According to an article by James Finch and
Gladstone on the law (CTLR 2000: 67-70), as of March 2000, the Council
had not promulgated any such permission or prohibition, implying that
crypto import and export may be unrestricted.

## 2. Domestic laws and regulations  
Cryptography is said to be restricted through a licensing regime.
