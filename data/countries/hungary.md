## 1. Export/ import controls  
[Wassenaar](#co) and [EU](#eu_exp) export controls are implemented
through the Government Decree No. 50/2004 *(III.23.) on Licensing
foreign trade in dual-use goods and technologies* ([text in
Hungarian](http://www.millenia.eu/cms/pdf/kettős%20felhasználású%20termékek%20és%20technológiák%20külkereskedelmi%20forgalma.pdf)),
updated with minor changes by Decree No. 13/2011 (II.22.) ([text in
Hungarian](http://www.complex.hu/jr/gen/hjegy_doc.cgi?docid=A1100013.KOR)).
Export of mass-market encryption software is exempted.\
Import of cryptography also falls under the Decree (see Part II): for
import from outside of the EU to Hungary, an International Import
Certificate is required (see artt. 14, 16ff).

## 2. Domestic laws and regulations  
A provision in the Hungarian [Digital Signature
Act](http://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/hjegy_doc.cgi?docid=A0100035.TV) (text
in Hungarian), which entered into force on 1 September 2001, holds that
signature-creation data (such as a cryptographic key) shall not be used
for other purposes than signing. The ministerial reasoning explains that
the intention of this is to prohibit the use of private keys for
cryptographic purposes, in the interest of national security. (Note that
cryptographic keys *not* used for creating signatures can be used for
encrypting.)

## 3. Developments in cryptography regulation  
In February 2001, the Data Protection Commissioner issued a
recommendation against regulating cryptography.
