**1. Export/ import controls**\
Import is allowed \"if it is declared by the importer not to be used for
production, development, collection or use of nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons.\"

Export is regulated according to the (pre-December 1998)
[Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) Arrangement, implemented in the *Law on the
control of export and import of goods and technologies subject to
international controls* and further regulations on licensing export and
import (regulations 43/1997 and 44/1997). However, the controls do not
seem to be enforced, and the official government document *Information
Policy of the Czech Republic - Strategy Basics* states: \"The state
shall not restrict import or export of cryptographic technologies.\"

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
None.

**3. Developments in cryptography regulation**\
No crypto regulation is expected.
