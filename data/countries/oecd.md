## 3. Developmentsin cryptography regulation  
The OECD released its [Recommendation of the Council concerning
Guidelines for Cryptography
Policy](http://www.oecd.org/dsti/sti/it/secur/prod/e-crypto.htm) on 27
March 1997. The guidelines are non-binding recommendations to Member
governments, meaning that they will not be part of international law.
The Guidelines provide principles which states should take into account
and balance in developing a national crypto policy. The principles are:

1.  Trust in cryptographic methods
2.  Choice of cryptographic methods
3.  Market driven development of cryptographic methods
4.  Standards for cryptographic methods
5.  Protection of privacy and personal data
6.  Lawful access
7.  Liability
8.  International co-operation

The principles should be seen as \"interdependent and should be
implemented as a whole so as to balance the various interests at stake.
No principle should be implemented in isolation from the rest.\"

Some have welcomed the OECD principles as a victory for privacy over
US-pushed key recovery, while others object to certain points as being
too inflexible or too vague. Although the guidelines do not endorse key
recovery, they do not prohibit it either. In fact, the guidelines are
vague enough to allow a broad range of interpretation, and states will
be able to choose a privacy-oriented or a law-enforcement-driven policy
line as they see fit. While the guidelines recommend states to cooperate
to coordinate their crypto policies, one may be skeptical about the
chances of governments coming to an agreement; after all, within the
OECD, states have not been able to agree, and they have left the task of
finding a balance between, roughly speaking, information security/
privacy and law-enforcement/ national security to individual states.

Cf. Stewart Baker\'s [analysis of and comments on the OECD
guidelines](http://www.steptoe.com/comment.htm).

The process of discussing and drafting policy guidelines started with an
[Ad-hoc Meeting of Experts on Cryptography
Policy](http://www.us.net/~steptoe/276908.htm) on 18-19 December 1995,
organized by the OECD Committee for Information, Computer and
Communications Policy (ICCP). They proposed to make a study upon current
Member Countries encryption policies, market for encryption, key escrow
encryption, and to develop a cryptography policy guideline based on the
following principles, among others: provides security with confidence,
voluntary use, international perspective, recognise national
responsibilities, legally effective. The Group of Experts on Security,
Privacy and Intellectual Property Protection in the Global Information
Infrastructure held subsequent meetings on [7-8 February
1996](http://pandora.nla.gov.au/nph-arch/2000/Z2000-Aug-16/http://oecdconf/oecdconf.html)
in Canberra, on 8 May 1996 in Washington, DC, on 26-28 June in Paris,
and on 26-27 September 1996, again in Paris. At the June 1996 meeting,
according to one report, no agreement was established; the OECD was said
to be split into two parties, one with countries favouring mandatory key
escrow (notably the US, UK, and France), and one with countries opposing
this approach (mainly Japan and the Scandinavian countries). See a 1
October 1996 [press
release](http://www.epic.org/events/crypto_paris/releaseE_OECD.html).

One can compare the final version to an earlier [draft of the
Guidelines](http://www.ozemail.com.au/~firstpr/crypto/oecd_dr2.htm) that
was discussed at the December 1996 meeting (with rather optimistic
personal comments by Robin Whittle). (Text between \[square brackets\]
remained to be decided upon.) In January 1997, the OECD Group of Experts
on Security. Privacy, and Intellectual Property Protection in the GII
concluded the guidelines. The Guidelines were finally turned into a
Council of the OECD resolution in March 1997.
