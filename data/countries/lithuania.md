**1. Export/ import controls**\
Lithuania has signed the [Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) Arrangement, and export
controls are regulated according to these regulations, by law of 25 June
1998 amending the [Law Concerning Control of Import, Transit and Export
of Strategic Goods and
Technologies](http://www3.lrs.lt/cgi-bin/preps2?Condition1=145348&Condition2=)
(see also the [current
version](http://www3.lrs.lt/cgi-bin/preps2?Condition1=172393&Condition2=),
in Lithuanian). Licenses for export can be obtained from the Ministry of
Economy.

Import controls do not seem to be distinguished from export controls,
and so, import licenses would be required for the listed crypto
products.

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
None.

**3. Developments in cryptography regulation**\
None.
