**1. Export/ import controls**\
Luxembourg has signed the [Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) Arrangement, so export
controls should be regulated according to the (pre-December 1998)
regulations, including the General Software Note.

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
None.

**3. Developments in cryptography regulation**\
A draft *Law on Electronic Commerce* ([text](http://www.etat.lu/ECO/) in
French, Word; [text](http://www.telepathic.com/lux) in French, html) was
proposed in mid-1999. It affirms in article 2 that the use of
cryptography is free. Because cryptography is one of the major problems
for law enforcement, the draft proposes a new article 66-1 in the Code
of Criminal Procedure. The investigating judge (and only he) can command
someone whom he considers to have a specific knowledge of the
encryption, to give him access to the \"understanding of the seized
protected or encrypted data\" (\"donne accès (\...) à la compréhension
de données saisies protégées ou cryptées\"). The command can not be
given to a suspect; the persons protected in articles 72, 73 and 76 of
the CCP and persons who are obliged to keep secret information given
them in the course of their professional activities, can excuse
themselves. Otherwise, the person addressed is required to cooperate,
under threat of a fine of LuxF 100,000 maximum.
