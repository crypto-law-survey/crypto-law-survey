**1. Export/ import controls**\
Import of encryption devices is restricted in South Korea through a
government policy, not by legislation; it requires approval from the
Ministrry of Trade, Industry, and Energy. The import of encryption
devices is prohibited, even for banks. The government is considering a
law to give this a legal basis. The import of encryption software is not
controlled. However, one report claims that the import license system
was abolished several years ago.

South Korea has signed the [Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) Arrangement, so
export controls should be regulated according to the (pre-December 1998)
regulations, including the General Software Note.

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
It seems that encryption services provided within a public switch
telephone network can be restricted on an ad-hoc basis. There is no
regulation governing the use of encryption.

**3. Developments in cryptography regulation**\
Encryption policy is not published, despite a 1994 indication by the
Ministry of Information and Communication that a policy would be
published defining acceptable public, private, government, and telephone
uses of encryption services and approved algorithms. Enquiries with the
Ministry indicate it does not have plans for specific legislation.

Draft bills on electronic signatures and electronic commerce, however,
may affect crypto use. The Draft Electronic Commerce Basic Law seems to
oblige people to provide the government with crypto keys.
