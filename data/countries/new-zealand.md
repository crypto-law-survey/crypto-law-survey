**1. Export/ import controls**\
New Zealand has signed the [Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) Arrangement, which it
implemented verbatim in 1999. The current law includes the General
Technology Note of Wassenaar, which exempts public-domain software from
controls. For export of mass-market software, the Wassenaar restrictions
hold.\
Export of cryptography was regulated through the Customs Act 1966 and
the Export Prohibition Regulations of 1953, and since October 1996 by
the Customs and Excise Act 1996. The responsible agency is the
International Security and Arms Control Division (ISAC) of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).

Approval is also required for software that does not itself contain
cryptography, but which has an interface specially designed for plugging
in cryptography. Export of crypto software by electronic means does not
fall under the export regulation.

Formerly, New Zealand did not implement the (pre-December 1998) General
Software Note of Wassenaar. A license was required to export
cryptography, including mass-market and public-domain software. What is
more, MFAT seemed to interpret the regulations very strictly, even to
the extent that publishing cryptography in books or academic journals
required permission, according to an [article by Peter
Gutman](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/policy/index.html).
However, the export regulations did not seem to have been enforced.

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
