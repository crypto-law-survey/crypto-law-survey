**1. Export/ import controls**\
Export is regulated according to the [EU](#eu_exp) regulations. Italy
has signed the [Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) Arrangement, including the
(pre-December 1998) General Software Note. See the law 185/90, New Norms
on the control of export, import and transit of arms materials.

The ministry responsible for crypto export is the [Ministero delle
Attività Produttive (area Commercio estero)](http://www.mincomes.it).

**2. Domestic laws and regulations**\
There is a law that demands accessibility of encrypted records for the
treasury.

There is also a law that requires radio-amateurs to transmit in
plaintext or in code from internationally accepted code books ([art.
330](http://digilander.libero.it/hamweb/norme/cp-ham.htm) Codice Postale
jo. art. 32 D.P.R. 447/2001).

Use of cryptography is also sometimes mandated by law. The Data
Protection Act, as amended by the 2003 New Privacy Code (Nuovo Codice
sulla Privacy), in force since 1 Jan 2004, requires in Annex B, art.
19.8, encryption (\"cifratura\") (or anonymisation) of personal data
that can disclose information about the health or sexual life of an
individual. Likewise, art. 24 of Annex B requires that electronic
transfer of genetic personal data outside of the premises reserved for
their processing (e.g., outside of the medical institution holding such
data) is encrypted (\"cifrato\"). The text of the New Privacy Code can
be found at the Italian Data Protection Authority\'s
[website](http://www.garanteprivacy.it/garante/navig/jsp/index.jsp?folderpath=Normativa%2FItaliana%2FIl+Codice+in+materia+di+protezione+dei+dati+personali){target="_blank"}.

**3. Developments in cryptography regulation**\
A 1992 proposal by the Minister of the Interior would have introduced a
licensing scheme for encryption and would have required producers and
importers of cryptography to deposit keys with the Ministry of Post and
Telecommunications. The proposal expired with the dissolution of the
parliament. A second, slightly modified version was never transformed
into a law proposal. Italy has apparently not thought of using Trusted
Third Parties for judicial access to keys.
