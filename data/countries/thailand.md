## 2. Domestic laws and regulations  
The Thailand Computer Crime Act, B.E. 2550 of 2007 (see [unofficial
translation](http://www.prachatai.com/english/node/117){target="_blank"})
contains a decryption order in computer-crime cases. Chapter 2, section
18 allows officials investigating a computer crime, with court approval,
to \"decode any person\'s computer data or instruct any person related
to the encryption of computer data to decode the computer data or
cooperate with a relevant competent official in such decoding\".
According to section 27 of the Act, failure to comply with a decryption
order is punishable by a fine of up to 200,000 baht \"and a further
daily fine of not more than five thousand baht until the relevant
corrective action has been taken\". The latter could imply that a person
can be given daily fines until s/he cooperates with decryption.
