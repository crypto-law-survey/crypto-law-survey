## 1. Export/ import controls  
Import, export, and transit of cryptography are regulated by the Import
and Export (Strategic Commodities) Regulations, which closely follow the
[Wassenaar](#Wassenaar) controls. Generally, a license is required from
the Director-General of Trade and Industry for importing or exporting
cryptography (symmetric over 56-bit key length), except for personal use
or for generally available, unchangeable crypto. Contravening the
licensing controls is punishable, on conviction on indictment, with an
unlimited fine or seven years\' imprisonment, and liable to
administrative sanctions. For more information, see the Strategic Trade
Controls Circular No. 12/04 on [Import and Export of Encryption
Products](http://www.stc.tid.gov.hk/english/circular_pub/stc12_04.html). 

## 2. Domestic laws and regulations  
There are no regulations on the use of encryption. Crypto products that
are to be connected to the public telecoms network, however, must comply
with the relevant Telecommunications Authority\'s network connection
specifications.

## 3. Developments in cryptography regulation  
The September 2000 [Report](http://www.info.gov.hk/sb/cr-rpt/report.htm)
of the Inter-departmental Working Group on Computer Related Crime
investigated the problem of cryptography for law enforcement. Ch. 5
recommends legislation for some form of decryption order. The order
should be modelled on current production orders of the Organized and
Serious Crimes Ordinance. As safeguards, the report recommends judicial
scrutiny, a requirement that the offence at issue has a maximum penalty
of at least two years\' imprisonment, and that there be legal protection
of the confidentiality of the information thus obtained. To enforce the
power, penalties \"commensurate with those for the specific offence
under investigation\" are recommended (although the report does not
suggest how the offence under investigation is to be determined if the
encrypted material does not yield evidence). Complying should be
possible by giving plain text or the necessary passwords, codes,
software and hardware to enable decryption. Suspects would be required
to comply, similar to suspects addressed with current production orders
(which do not have a privilege against self-incrimination clause).\
